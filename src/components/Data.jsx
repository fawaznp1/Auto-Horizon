    blog: "The 2025 Hyundai Elantra N is a performance-oriented compact sedan that offers an exciting driving experience, combining sporty aesthetics with robust features. Powered by a 2.0L turbocharged GDI 4-cylinder engine, it delivers 276 horsepower and a driving experience comparable to many electric vehicles, despite a relatively low average fuel economy of 23.1 mpg. Priced at $34,350 (tested at $37,545), it undercuts many EV counterparts in both price and performance. Key highlights include outstanding acceleration, tight handling from a sport-tuned suspension, reasonable interior space, and an NGS boost button that amps up speed for 20 seconds. The car comes fully loaded in a single trim featuring a Bose sound system, adaptive cruise control, heated seats, and a sunroof, among other amenities. However, it has minor drawbacks: tight bucket seats that can be uncomfortable on longer drives and excessive hard plastics in the cabin, which detract from the upscale feel. Despite these, the 2025 Elantra N is an appealing choice for enthusiasts, especially those who want a fun, sporty ride at a reasonable cost."
